- 👋 Hi, I’m Maja.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science projects, data analytics, R, statistics
- 🌱 I’m currently learning SQL, advanced R and advanced statistics/ML/data science
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects, find datasets and help other people + looking for a job in Croatia/remotely in Europe.
- 📫 You can reach me via my e-mail.
- I am keeping my code clean/tutorial-like, so every person can read it - professional data scientist or not, and tend to keep it that way all the times.
- I will post 2-3 projects a week, to show my process of learning new stuff in data science!
